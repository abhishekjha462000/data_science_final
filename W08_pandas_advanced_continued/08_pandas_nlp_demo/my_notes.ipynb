They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\""},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Process in NLP project\n\n1. data collecting\n\n2. data cleaning\n    - lowercasing\n    - removing leading and trailing spaces\n    - removing html tags\n    - removing urls\n    - expanding abbreviations\n    - spelling correction\n    - punctuations\n    - remove special characters(@, #, %, etc...)\n\n\n3. data preprocessing\n    - tokenization\n        - It is the process of breaking a sentence into tokens which are easier to deal with.\n    - stop word removal\n        - stop words are words which do not have any semantic value and are just there to help form the sentence.

quasi j-horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends. she finds that one, the daughter of the village priestess, drowned several years earlier. she and fumiko (another childhood friend) then learn that sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts. nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. unlike stellar j-horror films, the suspense doesn't really build, the result doesn't seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd.this movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy. sometimes you get this at poor asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long. you end up eating it, because you need it with the meal, because what is chinese or japanese food without rice, but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey, gooey tastelessness of it all. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies\""},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"####
