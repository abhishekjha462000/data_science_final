# Flask and Virtual Environment

1. While creating a flask app or fastapi or django app, we first need to install a virtual environment.
2. We can create a virtual env by the command : `virtualenv env`
3. After creating the virtual environment we can activate that virtual env by running the `activate` file
    inside the `Scripts` folder inside the virtual environment `env`.
4. Now see the python dependencies that are present inside this virtual environment `env` by running the
    command `pip list`.
5. This command will show the basic dependencies that have been installed in this virtual environment till
    now.
6. Now we can install `flask` or `django` or `fastapi` by pip.
